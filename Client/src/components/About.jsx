                        <h2>Why Servease?</h2>
                        <p>
                            Servease was born from a simple idea — to make everyday services accessible with just a few taps. 
                            Whether it's booking a cleaning service, a ride, or help with errands, we aim to bridge the gap between 
                            need and convenience. Our platform brings together reliable providers and everyday people, so you can 
                            spend less time worrying and more time living.
